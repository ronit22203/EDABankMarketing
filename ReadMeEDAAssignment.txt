Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Case Study: Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services
Overview
This assignment demonstrates the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario. The primary goal is to leverage data to understand and minimise risks associated with lending, ensuring that reliable applicants are not rejected while reducing financial losses from defaulters.

Business Understanding
Background
Loan providers often face challenges when assessing loan applications due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. This opens the door for potential defaults, which can impact business profitability. To mitigate these risks, companies rely on EDA to identify patterns and make informed decisions.

Objective
The company in this scenario specializes in lending to urban customers. It aims to:

Ensure profitability by approving loans for applicants likely to repay.
Minimize financial losses by rejecting or adjusting terms for applicants likely to default.
Key Risks
False Negatives: Rejecting applicants who are capable of repayment, leading to lost business opportunities.
False Positives: Approving loans for applicants likely to default, causing financial losses.
Data Overview
The provided dataset contains loan application details and the payment behavior of applicants. Key scenarios:

Clients with Payment Difficulties: Late payments exceeding a threshold.
Timely Payments: Applicants with a clean repayment record.
Loan Application Statuses:

Approved: Loan applications approved by the company.
Cancelled: Applications withdrawn by the client.
Refused: Applications rejected by the company.
Unused Offer: Offers canceled at various stages by the client.
Case Study Objectives
The case study focuses on identifying patterns and driver variables that indicate a client's likelihood of default. This information can be used to:

Deny loans to high-risk applicants.
Adjust loan amounts or terms for risky applicants.
Offer higher interest rates to mitigate risk.
Ultimately, this analysis helps the company improve its portfolio management and risk assessment.

Expected Outcomes
Identification of variables that strongly correlate with loan default.
Insights into consumer and loan attributes affecting repayment behavior.
Actionable strategies for:
Adjusting loan terms for high-risk applicants.
Approving loans for reliable applicants without unnecessary rejections.
